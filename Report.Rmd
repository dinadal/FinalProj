# Significance and Problem Statement:

The project addresses the fundamental issue of understanding the financial dynamics of college students in urban Saudi settings. While prior studies have explored similar themes on a global scale, there exists a dearth of research focusing specifically on the nuanced context of Saudi Arabian students within their local cities. This project bridges this gap by conducting a light literature review, summarizing existing works related to student spending behaviors and lifestyle choices. By drawing on this background, we contextualize our analysis, laying the foundation for our exploration into the unique challenges faced by students in major Saudi cities.


# Literature Review

Prior research has explored the financial behaviors of college students on a global scale, providing valuable insights into the challenges and dynamics of student spending. However, within the specific context of urban Saudi Arabia, there is a notable dearth of studies focusing on the nuanced intricacies of students' financial decisions. This light literature review aims to highlight key themes and findings from existing research, setting the stage for our exploration into the unique challenges faced by college students in major Saudi cities.

## Financial Behavior of Saudi College Students
Research specifically focusing on Saudi college students' financial behaviors is limited but growing. (Ali Saleh Alshebami & Theyazn H. H. Aldhyani, 2022) provides a foundational look into the spending habits of Saudi students, indicating a trend towards consumerism influenced by social circles and family support. This is echoed by the fac that financial support from families often dictates the spending habits and lifestyle choices of students in Saudi Arabia.

## The Role of Financial Education
In Saudi Arabia, the perceived need for financial education among college students is gaining attention. (Saeed, 2014) argue that the lack of formal financial education in the Saudi education system could lead to poor financial decisions among youths. This gap in the education system highlights the need for initiatives that can bolster financial literacy, particularly as the country's economy diversifies under Vision 2030.


## Socioeconomic Background and Spending Patterns
The relationship between socioeconomic status and spending behavior is a critical area of study. (Hamdan, Sue L.T. Mcgregor, & Elhassan, 2021) explored this within the Saudi context, finding that students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to exhibit more significant consumerist behaviors. These patterns are also influenced by the rapidly changing retail landscape in urban areas, as discussed by (Otaibi & Kausar Yasmeen, 2014), who highlighted the proliferation of malls and luxury goods as a factor in student spending.


## Cultural Influences on Financial Behavior
Saudi Arabia's cultural norms and values exert a strong influence on spending habits. (Alsahafi & Shin, 2017) examined how cultural expectations, particularly around events and social gatherings, can lead to increased expenditure among college students. The pressure to maintain social status through material possessions is particularly pronounced in urban centers where there is greater exposure to luxury and consumerist lifestyles.


## Lifestyle Choices and Expenditure Patterns
The lifestyle choices of Saudi college students, including leisure activities, dining out, and travel, are influenced by a combination of globalized cultural trends and local traditions (Qahwaji, 2023).(Al & Abu, 2023) highlight how the pursuit of a modern lifestyle among students in urban centers can lead to increased discretionary spending.


## Cultural and Familial Influence
Saudi society maintains strong familial ties, and this extends into the financial behaviors of college students. (Al-Rethaiaa, Fahmy, & Alshwaiyat, 2010) suggests that family allowances are the primary source of income for many students, which can lead to a lack of financial autonomy and experience in managing personal finances. The cultural emphasis on generosity and hospitality can also lead to increased social spending.


In conclusion, our literature review has laid a foundational understanding of the existing knowledge on college student lifestyle and spending patterns, particularly within major cities of Saudi Arabia. Through scrutinizing various studies, we've identified key factors that influence these patterns and have revealed a substantial gap in localized research. This synthesis will serve as a cornerstone for our own analysis, allowing for a more tailored approach to understanding and predicting the behaviors of Saudi college students. The insights derived from our review will guide the methodology of our primary research and ensure that it is grounded in a robust theoretical framework.



## Global Perspective:

Numerous studies have delved into the financial behaviors of college students worldwide, revealing common themes such as the impact of socioeconomic background, academic pressures, and lifestyle choices on spending habits. Research by Rehr et al identified a strong correlation between financial stress and academic performance, emphasizing the need for targeted support systems (Rehr et al., 2022).

## Regional Variances:
